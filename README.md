## Environment Variables

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```env
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin@123
NODE_ENV=development

# CORS Configuration
# For local development:
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000

# For production (comma-separated for multiple origins):
# CORS_ORIGIN=https://assignment-green-nine.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
```

### Frontend (`frontend/.env.local`)

```env
# For local development:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikshantshukla123/Assignment.git
cd Assignment
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and CORS origin

# Start development server
npm start
```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:4000`.

**Note**: An initial admin user is automatically created on first run using credentials from .env

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
# Open a new terminal and navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Default Admin Credentials

- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** Admin@123

---

## Application Flow

1. User logs in and receives a JWT.  
2. JWT is stored in localStorage and cookies.  
3. Dashboard loads announcements using REST APIs.  
4. Socket.IO establishes an authenticated connection.  
5. New announcements are delivered in real time.  
6. On page refresh, announcements are restored from the database.  

---

## Security Notes

- Passwords are stored using bcrypt hashing.  
- Password fields are excluded from queries by default (`select: false`).  
- Frontend middleware is used only for route redirection.  
- All authentication and authorization checks are enforced on the backend.  

---

## Deployment

- Backend can be deployed on platforms like Render or Railway.  
- Frontend can be deployed on Vercel.  
- Environment variables must be configured on the hosting platform.  

---
### Future goals:
pagination - Activity logs limited to 100
search/filter - Could add to user/admin tables 
tests - Unit/integration tests 
rate limiting - Could add to prevent spam 

### Cold Start Notice

This application is deployed using a free-tier hosting service (Render).
Due to this, the backend may go to sleep after periods of inactivity.

The first request after inactivity may take 20–60 seconds while the server wakes up.
Subsequent requests will work normally.

In a production environment, this would be resolved by using an always-on instance.
